*This is me -- Pablo.*

Born and raised in Tucum√£, Brazil, which is a small town in the Amazon. I have a background in Computer Science, and I love to code and build tech products. My hobbies are hiking, binge watching Netflix original series, and eating Asian food.

I am a Software Engineer student at Flatiron School in Brooklyn, and in the next 15 weeks I will be trained to use several latest technologies for web development, including but not limited to: Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, JQuery, D3, Git, Github, Node.JS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, among others.
